Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an increasingly popular technology field with various applications. NLP is being utilized in several use cases such as text summarization, chatbot, machine translation, and text generation. In this article, we explore a mini NLP project that involves the development of a YouTube Transcript Extractor. The YouTube Transcript Extractor is designed to provide users with a brief overview of a large tutorial or video before watching it. The tool summarizes the content (subtitle) of the YouTube video, which allows users to save time and gain a quick understanding of the video's content.

The YouTube Transcript Extractor is particularly useful for videos that have a longer duration where the core content is only a small percentage of the total video length. The tool extracts all the important points of the video and presents them in an easy-to-understand format. This is especially beneficial for students and professionals who require summaries of lecture videos to review the material. Overall, the YouTube Transcript Extractor is an excellent example of how NLP can be applied to solve real-world problems and save users time and effort.
